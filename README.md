## Tomato Farming Advisory AI System: Disease Detection, Adaptive Chatbot & Early Warnings
üå± Project Overview
The Tomato Farming Advisory AI System is a comprehensive, AI-powered solution tailored for tomato farmers. It integrates three essential components: a deep learning model for tomato leaf disease detection, an AI chatbot that provides adaptive agricultural guidance, and an early warning system for pest, disease, or drought threats. The system helps farmers make smarter, timely, and data-driven decisions to boost yield and reduce losses.

üöÄ Key Features of the Project
Tomato Leaf Disease Detection from uploaded images using deep learning.

AI-Powered Farming Chatbot for personalized and real-time agronomic advice.

Early Warning System based on satellite/local data for pest, disease, or drought threats.

User-Friendly Interface with HTML/CSS and Flask backend, deployed via Streamlit.

Scalable & Modular Architecture that allows part-by-part deployment and upgrades.

üõ†Ô∏è Project Implementation Steps
1. Define the Problem and Scope
Many tomato farmers struggle with identifying diseases early and getting reliable advice.

This system aims to provide a virtual advisory assistant using AI vision, NLP, and geospatial data.

2. Data Collection
Collected tomato leaf image datasets (healthy and diseased) from open-source platforms.

Curated domain-specific questions/answers for chatbot training.

Sourced weather and pest outbreak data from publicly available APIs and platforms.

3. Model Selection
Chose CNN-based models (e.g., MobileNet) for image classification due to their lightweight and high accuracy.

Selected OpenAI's GPT-like models or local LLMs for natural language interaction.

Simple rule-based early warning logic with optional ML integration for forecast anomalies.

4. Model Training and Evaluation
Preprocessed images: resizing, augmentation, normalization.

Trained model on disease classification, evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

Fine-tuned chatbot responses for relevance and farmer-centric language.

5. Build a User Interface
Designed a web UI with HTML/CSS to resemble a digital assistant dashboard.

Integrated Flask as a lightweight backend for routing and inference handling.

Streamlit used to quickly deploy and serve the app online.

6. Deployment
Split the app into modules: model inference, chatbot logic, and early warning.

Deployed initially on Streamlit Cloud for public access.

Added requirements.txt, .streamlit/config.toml, and modular directory structure.

7. Testing and Validation
Validated disease detection model with test image sets.

Simulated chatbot queries to test knowledge accuracy and response time.

Cross-checked early warning output with real pest/disease alerts.

8. Documentation and Reporting
Wrote project README, setup guides, comments in scripts, and architecture diagrams.

Maintained a utils/ folder for reusable functions and helpers.

üß© Handling Challenges
Model Compatibility Issues between .h5 and newer .keras formats in Streamlit.

Streamlit deployment limitations led to modular component deployment.

Maintaining chatbot relevance across diverse farming queries.

Aligning real-time weather or pest data with farmer needs.

üéØ Expected Outcomes
Reduced crop loss due to early disease detection and guidance.

Empowered farmers with 24/7 access to a virtual farming assistant.

Better preparedness for environmental threats with early warnings.

Scalable model for use in other crops and farming regions.

ü§î Why This Project?
This project blends AI in agriculture (AgriTech) with real-world impact, making intelligent farming accessible to smallholder farmers. It's an opportunity to:

Use data science for societal benefit.

Innovate with end-to-end AI solutions (vision + NLP + geodata).

Empower the agricultural sector through technology.
